These are basically the types of variables.
let us consider the previous example from variables topic.
a=6
a="harshith"
a=9.0


#integers
here 6 is an integer type,decimals are not allowed here it includes negative values,positive values and zero.

#float
9.0 is of float type 

#strings
harshith is string,string are enclosed with "" or ''

#boolean
It only includes two values: True,False

we will learn about list,tuple and dictionary in the later part,we will see the practical implementationin the later topics
unlike other languages u need not seperately define them,u can just assign directly python understands accordingly.
