In python we have print as output functon and inout as input function


#input
syntax:
variable_name=datatype(input("text you want to display"))
eg:
number1=int(input("please enter the first number"))
#output
syntax:
print(variable,"text you want to enter")
eg:
print(number1,"is the number")
let the number entered be 6 for instance
o/p:6 is the number
print("the number is",number1)
o/p:the number is 6
print("the first number",number1,"is what you have entered")
o/p:the first number 21 is what you have entered
the usage depends on how you want to print.
