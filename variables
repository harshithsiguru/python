python is currently the most widely used high level programming,multi purpose language.
lets get started...
we will discuss here about variables.
A variable can be imagined to be a bag that carries some items in general terms,varibales in python are case-sensitive(means harshith is completely different from Harshith)
lets look at some examples...
a=6
a="harshith"
a=9.0
here a is the variable and 6,harshith,9.0 are values assigned to the variable a.we will get in depth about those values in data types file
